## "More Stuff" Mods

These are the mods that actually add more parts and possibilities to your game.

### DMagic Orbital Science

In stock KSP, the methods of gathering Science tend to be strongly biased towards manned sample-return missions.  Crew reports, EVA reports, and surface samples all require crew, and you typically only get 30% or 40% if you transmit experiment results rather than bringing them home (even if that doesn't really make sense for most of them).

[DMagic Orbital Science][dmagic] doesn't change any of the existing science tools, but it adds a lot more, all strongly based on real-life science and existing probe tools.

Examples include the Radio and Plasma Wave Science (RPWS) instrument (based on the Cassini probe) that measures radio and plasma fields in space to learn about planetary magnetic fields and the solar wind, or the Laser Ablation Spectroscopy unit (based on Curiosity's ChemCam module) which fires lasers at soil and measures the chemical composition of the vaporised dust.

Most of these tools can also transmit their data at full value, then go on to collect more — although some (like the Solar Particle Collector) do limit how many samples you can take and require returning for full value.

Also, several tools have extensive writeups in the DMagic mod release thread, which are well worth a read if you're wondering how the instrument actually works.  Between these descriptions and the actual science reports these instruments produce, this is probably the most educational mod KSP has ever had.

The flip side, of course, is that you can now get more science and unlock things faster than in stock.  Whether that's a good thing or not is up to you, but personally, I appreciate having more ways to collect science, especially via the more realistic "unmanned probe" approach.

Note that all the DMagic instruments also come with Universal Storage wedge versions.  These are included directly in the DMagic mod, so you don't need to install anything extra.

### Kerbal Attachment System

Ever had a valuable rocket run out of fuel and wish you could call a tow truck or get a quick refuel?  Or maybe you made a space station but forgot to put any lights on it?

If so, [Kerbal Attachment System][KAS] is the mod for you.  It allows Kerbals to EVA and attach/detach various things to ships, store and retrieve things from containers, and connect ships together using winches, pipes, and even grappling hooks.

Kerbals now have some rudimentary ability to pick up smaller items like lights, antennae, solar panels, RTGs, etc.  They can carry these items on their back, then attach them at a point of your choosing.  You can also mount containers on your ships to store or retrieve these small items, or even carry those containers on a Kerbal's back.

With a winch or pipe between ships, you can tow ships along or keep them from drifting apart.  You can also optionally dock them together to form a single ship, allowing you to transfer resources and crew between them.  I've even had the opportunity to tow a 300-tonne asteroid using multiple winch cables!

KAS also provides this general "grab and carry stuff" framework for other mods, and some of them make use of it when available.   For example, Universal Storage wedges can be removed and reinstalled using KAS.  And if you install the Universal Storage KAS pack, you also get a KAS Storage wedge that acts like an inline container.

### SCANsat

If you've ever wished for a simple flat map of a planet, or wanted to know where all the biomes are so you can squeeze out that last bit of science, then you need [SCANsat][scansat].

By attaching one of the scanning tools to a ship and then flying over the surface of the planet or moon, you can slowly fill in a map of the entire surface.  Different instruments will fill in different map layers, such as surface topology or biomes, and are designed to operate at different scanning altitudes.

Background scanning is supported, meaning you can put a satellite in a polar orbit and leave it there, slowly scanning the entire planet, while you do other missions.  And, once you're done, you can analyse the data and transmit it back home for a small bit of Science.

This mod doesn't really have a huge impact on gameplay, but it does help add a sense of exploration.  The maps themselves can also be useful for plotting future missions — particularly for finding flat places to land, or for determining a latitude and longitude to punch into MechJeb for a precise landing.

### RealChute

The [RealChute][realchute] mod is a reworking of the parachute system, offering tons of new options for parachute deployment.  It comes in nosecone, radial, and even stack versions, and offers a much more comprehensive set of options for how to slow your craft down for landing.

Parachutes now come in three varieties — main, drogue, and drag.  The main chutes are what you'd expect for slowing a craft down to touchdown speeds, but now the smaller drogue chutes can be used to help slow the craft down to a safer speed such that the main chutes don't risk ripping off.  Drag chutes can be used by planes to bleed off speed on the runway, and won't auto-cut on touchdown like stock parachutes.

All RealChute parachutes are fully resizable and customisable with profiles, accessed using the "Action Group" mode in the editor.  Parachutes can be set to auto-deploy at a particular altitude or pressure once manually armed, and can also be set to wait for a negative vertical velocity (i.e. only while descending).  They also deploy more gradually than stock, spreading out the G forces and reducing the deployment shock, even under time acceleration.

If you've ever had trouble with the stock parachutes, give RealChute a go.  Personally, I always feel a lot safer landing with a RealChute parachute.

### EVA Parachutes

Even RealChutes sometimes snap if you use them incorrectly.  For those embarassing moments where your command pod is hurtling to its doom with snapped parachutes, you need [Vanguard Technologies EVA Parachutes][eva-para].  This adds personal parachutes, giving you an extra line of defense against [unplanned lithobraking][lithobraking].

Personally, I also install the extra plugin file that gives all Kerbals parachutes at all times — when I'm hurtling through the atmosphere, I don't have the time to open a parachute box and grab one!  This has saved my Kerbals on several occasions, including one where I evacuated and safely parachuted all three Kerbals from a Mark 3 pod landing gone wrong.

### TweakScale

[TweakScale][tweakscale] allows you to make almost any part larger or smaller.  Want a giant ion engine?  Go ahead!  A probe-sized standard fuel tank?  Why not!  There's a ton of possibilities.

If you're concerned about balance, TweakScale does scale the mass and capacity of each part, and I've generally found that e.g. an array of engines is more efficient that just scaling an engine up.  So far, I haven't managed to produce anything that felt particularly imbalanced with it.


## Off-World Resources

### MKS / OKS

If you're using a life support mod such as TAC, you know that all manned missions will eventually run out of resources and must either be resupplied or come to an end.  But what if there were a way to extend your resources, or even create a closed system that didn't need resupplying?

The [Modular/Orbital Kolonization System][MKS], or "MKS" / "OKS", does just that.  It comes either in the form of several standalone modules that you can connect to each other via inflatable tubes on a planet's surface, or in the form of orbital modules that you can dock to each other.  Either way, it allows completed closed-loop recycling of all life support resources … eventually.

It's worth noting that this isn't a cheap "get out of life support free" card.  Setting these systems up takes a lot of time and effort, even if you include some resources from Kerbin to get things started.  Just setting up a greenhouse is going to involve a colony hub, an aeroponics module, several agricultural modules, a terraformer, some Kerbitats to house your Kerbals so you can collect their waste for compost, etc etc.

But the end result is something that really feels like a living, breathing colony.  Or so I'm guessing, anyway, since I've never actually gotten around to making an MKS/OKS colony.  But I've been eyeing this mod pretty closely, and I'm definitely planning on building some in my next game.

MKS also features some drills that you can use to extract various elements from planets, including ore, water, minerals, substrate, etc.  These can be turned into various useful materials, whether you use MKS or not.  For example, with Universal Storage's *Elektron*, you can break water apart into hydrogen and oxygen via electrolysis, just like on nuclear submarines or the International Space Station.  This can cut down your need for resupply missions, since between solar, water drilling, and electrolysis, you've covered all your life support needs except food.

### Kethane and Karbonite

Ever wanted to drill a moon for fuel instead of having to haul it up through Kerbin's atmosphere?  These mods let you do that.

[Kethane][kethane] and [Karbonite][karbonite] are two different fuel-like substances that you can drill and extract from the ground of most planets and moons.  Each can then be converted into most of the fuels available in the game — fuel, oxidiser, monopropellant, xenon for ion engines, and sometimes even solid fuel for boosters.

The main difference between these two mods is that Kethane is finite while Karbonite is not.  With Kethane, planets are divided into hex grids, and some grid tiles will have a finite amount of Kethane available (if any).  If you try drilling anywhere else, you won't find it, and if you drill a single tile too much, you'll eventually run out.  In theory, you can strip an entire moon of all its Kethane and be done with it.

Karbonite, on the other hand, is infinite, and is based on density.  You can touchdown anywhere and drill for it, but unless you've hit a deposit, you'll just get a slow trickle.  The shape, location, and density of these deposits is specified by a planet-wide gradient map rather than coarse tiles.  You can also collect Karbonite from oceans, or by flying through a gas giant atmosphere with a collector.

Scanning is also different in each mod.  Kethane requires that you fly over each grid tile with a detector to determine how much Kethane it contains.  Karbonite technically requires no real scanning, since the detector will immediately highlight all hotspots across the entire surface.  However, you'll need the SCANsat mod if you want to know exact shapes and densities, and you'll need to scan the entire surface the same as you would with SCANsat — but you can leave the probe alone and go do other things, whereas Kethane won't scan anything if your probe isn't the active ship.

There's also some more technical and political differences between the two.  Karbonite is based on the Open Resource System — which (I gather) was created mainly to deal with the technical and licensing issues of Kethane — but it's now moving towards the author's new "Regolith" framework, which will support asteroid mining as well.  All in all, it seems that Karbonite is the more advanced and ongoing solution, while Kethane hasn't really changed much in a while.

Which mod you choose depends on your preferences and play style.  If you're setting up a large ground-based colony (particularly an MKS one) and you plan on harvesting a lot of fuel, you may want to go with Karbonite, because you don't want to be sitting on tonnes of scrap when the Kethane wells go dry.  If you hate the idea of infinite fuel mining and don't mind babysitting your scanner probes, Kethane works fine.  Personally, I prefer Karbonite, but both frameworks are popular enough that most add-on mods will support both of them.

### Extraplanetary Launchpads

Of all the mods I've listed here, I think it's safe to say that [Extraplanetary Launchpads][EPL] ("EPL") has the most potential to change how you play KSP.

In a nutshell, EPL does what the title suggests: It lets you set up launchpads, runways, and orbital construction docks ouside of Kerbin's atmosphere.  You can use these launchpads to build and launch ships — all you need is the equivalent mass of "RocketParts".  You can also recycle existing ships, recovering all of their resource contents and about 80% of their tonnage as parts.

If that's all it did, EPL would still be pretty revolutionary — now you could build giant space-faring ships that you would never be able to get into Kerbin orbit, without needing to build them up piece-by-piece with docking ports.  You might have to launch dozens of supply missions to do it, but it would be quite doable.

But EPL goes one step further, and lets you mine planets for ore, then smelt that ore to metal, and finally convert that metal into rocketparts.  If you build a surface base on an ore deposit, you can mine it and launch dozens of ships right from there — no atmosphere, and a much easier gravity well, particularly on Minmus.  Add some Kethane or Karbonite and you can launch them all fully fuelled, too.  And even if you're running an orbital base instead, you just need to occasionally send a ship down to the surface to grab some ore and bring it back up.
