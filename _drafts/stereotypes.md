So here’s my more in-depth counter-point to that "offended by political correctness" video going around earlier this week:

When the "politically correct" people say "that's offensive and you should consider not doing that" — or go further and actually boycott you — it's not that we're trying to censor you.  It's not that we're thin-skinned and can't “handle” what you're saying.
What we're really saying is, you are a public figure.  There are people — particularly young people — who emulate you, or for whom you help define their view of the world.  You have sway.  You have influence.  And we want you, we need you to think more carefully about how you use that influence.

Every time you make a well-endowed superheroine who wears spandex and is constantly drawn in provocative poses, it doesn’t matter how smart or assertive or independent you make her — teenagers are going to drool over her, and are going to come away even more certain that women only exist as objects for their visual enjoyment.  Even the younger children will start to think that you have to be beautiful (and a narrow definition thereof!) to be a “good guy” (or gal) — something Disney has taught them for ages.

Every time you give your white male characters real variation and personalities, but make the black character a warrior or a gangster, the Asian character a monk or a kung fu artist, the woman a temptress or housewife, etc., you reinforce the notion that only white men matter, and the rest are just fodder, there to fill in their standard roles.

Every time media uses the same stereotypes or generalisations, it helps cement those in the minds of their viewers — the same viewers who may produce media of their own, now or in the future, continuing the cycle.  But more than that,
