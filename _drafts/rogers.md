*(content warning: #firstworldproblems)*

For over a year now, I've been paying too much for internet.

That's not some subjective call; it's not me saying "man, these prices are awful, I'm getting ripped off here" (though I am).  It's an objective reality: Rogers slashed their internet prices almost in half and never bothered to tell me.  Or update my bill.  (Even after I moved and got a new modem.)

So, long story short: I signed up many years ago, back when Rogers Ultimate was something like $135/month for 100 Mbps down and 10 Mbps up.  (Why?  Because I work in tech, internet is my lifeblood, and I have plenty to spend on it.)

I always got way more download speed than advertised — typically over 200 Mbps.  Steam downloads would come down at 20 MB/s, or basically 1GB/minute.  Lovely.

I also got the $30 flat-rate “give me unlimited monthly bandwidth” option.  It wasn’t that I was frequently exceeding their limits; I just wanted peace of mind.  So we’re up to $165/mo.

Fast forward to late 2015, when I discover that Rogers has launched their “Ignite” series of internet packages (back in March).  My 100/10 package, with unlimited per month?  Now only $90/mo.  I’ve been paying almost double what I should be.

Did Rogers ever tell me?  Would they have, eventually?  Hell no.  I only found out because I was browsing their packages to see if there were any new ones.  Thanks, Rogers!

And yet, for months, I kept on knowingly paying that extra $75 for what was now worth $90.

Why?  Because everything was working fine.  My connection was rock solid.  I was getting more speed than advertised.  I would probably have to trade in my modem.  And who knows how Rogers would almost certainly manage to fuck something up if I tried to change anything?

But, this weekend, I finally decided it was time.  I disconnected my modem for the first time since I moved in, and brought it to a Rogers store.  I figured, odds were 99% that I would have to trade it in, and I may as well skip the on-hold phone time and get it done all at once.

First visit, I’m all ready to go, and then they ask for photo ID.  Well, I don’t drive, so I don’t have a driver’s license.  I’d normally use my passport, but I forgot that.  But I finally got this fancy new health card with an actual photo, so thank god for that, and …

… You don’t accept health cards?  Unlike almost anyone else who asks me for ID?  Well that’s just fucking great.  The whole family had errands in the area, so I figured we could all go together, and I’d hang out at the Rogers store.  Instead, I’m stuck with nothing to do but wait for everyone to finish, so I can go home, get my ID, and go back out again.  Awesome.

My second visit, since our errands are done, I pick a store in a mall with less traffic that’s easier to reach by car.  Turns out it’s probably the busiest one in town.  I end up waiting for ages to get a tech.  We go through the whole long, drawn-out thing — I was rejiggering my cell phone and internet plans at the same time — I get a new modem, and I’m good to go.

I get home.  I hook the modem up.  It doesn’t work.  “Network access denied,” it says.  Fucking great.  I’m now having the shittiest day, and I’m pretty pissed off — as I rewire things and run diagnostics, anything that gets in my way gets flung across the room in anger.

I call up Rogers.  It turns out my connection is still linked to my old modem, and the store somehow fucked up and didn’t scan in the new modem correctly.  They asked me several times whether I really went to an official Rogers store (and not a third-party affiliated one), as though they couldn’t believe it.

And no, they couldn’t fix the problem from their end.  Of course not.  That would be too easy.  But hey, they’ll give me a one week credit for the trouble.  Gee, thanks.

By my third visit, I’m all angered-out, and now I’m just tired and resigned to this.  I take an Uber to and from the mall where I got the modem, because as patient and helpful as they are, I’m not about to bug the family for a third drive today.

I get it home.  It works!  My download speed is now even better, at upwards of 325 Mbps.  My upload speed …

… is still at 11 Mbps.  Despite the advertised 20.  Goddamnit.  I am so not dealing with this right now.

So I finally called Rogers up today, and it turns out that if you get the 250/20 plan and your area isn’t provisioned for 20 Mbps upload, you get silently downgraded to 10 Mbps.  They won’t bother telling you, and they certainly won’t give you a discount.

On the up side, I can expect gigabit speeds here in Ottawa sometime before the end of the year.  For $150/mo (less than I was paying before, remember) I’ll be able to get 1000/50.

And when that happens, I’ll have to do this whole dance again …
