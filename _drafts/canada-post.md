So I figured it was finally time to learn to play this guitar that's been collecting dust next to me for years now.  To help me, I decided to buy two teaching games: *Rocksmith 2014* (PC) and *BandFuse: Rock Legends* (PlayStation 3).

Now, I don't actually have a PlayStation 3 yet (long story), and I was in much more of a rush to get *Rocksmith*.  So after some quick cross-border price comparisons — a fact of life for Canadian online shopping — I ordered *Rocksmith* from Amazon.com (priority courier international shipping) and *BandFuse* from Amazon.ca (free shipping; don't care how long).

Both packages were ordered late Monday night and shipped on Tuesday, with *Rocksmith* set to arrive via DHL courier on Thursday, and *BandFuse* coming via free Canada Post on … Wednesday?  Free *next-day* shipping?  Yeah, I guess there really *are* some perks to using Amazon.ca, despite the high prices.

So Wednesday rolls around, and even though I'm in no rush to get *BandFuse*, I still track all my deliveries like a hawk.  As the clock reaches 6pm (and my apartment building's office closes) with no delivery yet, I'm getting pretty skeptical about their delivery estimate.  But no, they still say they'll have it to me by 8pm.  Okay.  Okay.  Patience.

At 7:20, I check my tracking app.  Hm, what's this?

!["7:01: Attempted delivery.  Notice card left indicating where item can be picked up."](/img/2014/12/bandfuse-posted.png "Posted app")

I didn't hear any door buzzer at 7:01pm.

"OH YOU LITTLE SHI—…"

But quite literally before I can get that sentence out, my phone rings.  It's the door buzzer!  It's here!  Everything's fine!  It's all been a terrible misunderstanding!

I'm ready to come down to receive my package as usual, but the guy on the intercom asks me if I can buzz him in, because he's got several deliveries to make and it's easier for him to just come in and visit everyone.  What service!

I let him in.  He comes up to my floor.  I receive my package.  All is right in the world again.

But as I close the door, something's nagging at me.  Wasn't that guy wearing a DHL uniform?  Shouldn't that be a Canada Post worker?  Is this really the package I'm expecting?  Hmm.  I tear open the package, and find …

*Rocksmith 2014*?  The hell?

Yup.  Turns out, not only did DHL manage to get the package to me a day early (twice as fast as expected!), they even came up and delivered packages right to everyone's doors — despite all the extra Christmas business and our slow-as-molasses elevators.

Meanwhile, Canada Post can't even be bothered to ring a door intercom.  Building office closed?  Too bad, no package for you.  Hope you like walking three kilometres in the snow to get your stuff.

And so I say, dear Canada Post: You should be ashamed of yourselves.  You just got beat out by a low-cost international courier who *wasn't even supposed to be here today.*  Honestly, if you're going to be that lazy and/or understaffed, I would have preferred you just call it a day and deliver it tomorrow, when the building office is open and you can thus actually be bothered to deliver something *other* than a sheet of paper telling me to go fuck myself.

But hey, I've got another delivery tomorrow that you'll probably also find a way to botch … so at least I only have to make **one** trip to the post office, right?

## Epilogue: Rock on, Steam

It's been so long since I installed a game from a disc that I wasn't even sure if my DVD drive would still work.  But it did, and so I started the *Rocksmith 2014* install.

Now, I love Steam.  I buy pretty much everything on Steam.  It's handy; it's flexible; it's social.  *Rocksmith* was my first non-Steam game in a long time.  I was a little bummed that I wouldn't be running it from the convenience of Steam, but it came with a special cable, and nobody's yet figured out how to sell physical cables as digital downloads.

So, as the installer loaded, I pulled up Steam, searched for *Rocksmith 2014*, and added it to my wishlist so that Steam would notify me if it went on sale.  After all, the holiday sale is coming up, and I figured that if they happened to offer *Rocksmith* for a deep discount — say, 75% or deeper — I honestly wouldn't mind buying it again, purely for the sake of convenience.  That's just how I roll.

I start to click through the *Rocksmith* installer, and it asks me for the code printed on the insert.  How quaint!  I grab the box and start typing in the code.

But wait … that colour scheme … that message … isn't that … ?

Yup.  The installer is a Steam "install from disc" launcher.  The code on the insert?  A Steam product activation key.  *Hell yeah!*  Or at least, that's what I would've said, if I weren't laughing so hard.

And that's how I ended up wishlisting a Steam game I already owned and *just didn't know it yet.*

(Of course, I also ended up just aborting the install and downloading it instead once I realised that my internet was twice as fast as my DVD drive.  No wonder physical PC games retail is dying!)
