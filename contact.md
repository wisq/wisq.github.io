If you'd like to reach me directly, please feel free to contact me via the Twitter button at the bottom of any page.

If you're part of the [hangops Slack community][hangops], I'm `@wisq` there.

If you're having an issue with the site, technical or otherwise, you can [check and create issues][issues] on this website's own Github project page.

I play a lot of video games, and if you'd like to play with me, I'm mainly [on Steam][steam].  Just remember that I don't usually accept unsolicited Steam friend requests from people I don't know, so you probably want to introduce yourself via one of the other methods first.

Sometimes I stream games [on Twitch][twitch], and you can follow me there to get notified the next time I stream.  If there's a game in my library that you'd like to see, let me know.
